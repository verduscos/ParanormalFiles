       title="It came for us in the graveyard",
       description="We were driving my friend's really old beat up Subaru through a massive graveyard. We stopped and walked down a hill and came across a little pond. There was someone sitting on a rock on the other side of the pond. The figure was all black and we couldn't make out any features other than the fact it looked like a man who was wearing some old-style top hat. We stupidly waved and shouted “Hi!”. He didn't show any acknowledgement and continued sitting still on the rock. All of a sudden, he jumped to his feet, started running to us on the water and then vanished in thin water about halfway on the pond. My friends and I screamed and ran back to the car.\n The car wouldn't start, and we heard something banging on the back of the car. It wasn't a constant bang, but every few seconds or so we'd hear it. Nobody was outside from what we could see in the dark, but something was making a noise on the car. I opened my phone and started dialing my mom to come give us a boost, but I had no service. None of us had any cell service. The next 30 minutes were spent trying to get her car started. No banging was heard afterwards, but we felt this heavy pressure around us. \n Finally, the car started and she hit the pedal to the metal. We sped out of the graveyard so fast. Immediately crossing the gates, all of our phones regained cell service. One thing I know for certain is that someone or something was out there, and it was not an animal or a human.",

       description="After my parents divorced when I was a teenager, I lived with my mother. I experienced lots of paranormal happenings. Several times when I was reading in my bed, the room would start to feel really “icy.” Next, it would feel as if something/somebody that hated me was staring at me. When I got that feeling, I would leave the room and come back an hour later. Sometimes during the day, I would see a shadow figure sneaking along my bedroom walls. \n Something in the flat was pretending to be my dog. I went into my room and heard a deep growl from under the bed. My dog wasn't capable of making a noise that deep. It sounded like either a really big dog or a man doing his best dog impersonation. Other times, my dog would whimper and pace in the room next to mine but wouldn't come when called, as if he was afraid of something in the hallway. \n When I moved in with my father, the paranormal activity stopped.",

       description="I was 12 at the time and my family has a camp on the Tangipahoa River in Louisiana. The only way you can get to it is by boat. So it was just my uncle, my cousin, and myself and we were heading back to the boat launch on a Sunday night. Now the boat we were in didn't have any working lights, so to see where we were going my uncle would occasionally shoot a flare. We quickly ran out of the flares you shoot as it is around a 2-hour boat ride back to the landing. So I ended up on the front of the boat holding a regular flare as we were now on a much narrower stretch of river. \n to the right. I was just trying to keep the flare from burning me, and my little cousin was freaking out. After around 10 minutes of them navigating through the swamp, they formed a triangle above us on the river. It is hard to gauge how far up they were, but it was very visible. \n They continued to follow us for the rest of the journey back to the landing, and as soon as we arrived they disappeared. This all happened around 18 years ago but it is something I will never forget. I don't talk about this stuff really and usually just keep it to myself.",

       title="My Grandma saw my Grandpa",
       description="(okay, not me, but my family). \n My grandfather was a baaad man. Alcoholic, extremely violent, tried to kill my grandmother in front of their kids. One of his less horrible acts was abandoning my grandmother with their six kids, all under the age of 12. Some of his kids maintained minimal contact with him. He lived about thirty or forty miles from my grandmother and the two kids who'd stayed in the area. \n When he was in his 80s he was hospitalized and then passed away in the middle of the night. In the morning his oldest child, one of my aunts, went to the morgue to identify the body and fill out paperwork. On her way she stopped by my grandmother's to break the news. When she came in my grandmother said 'oh it's a sad day. He died just past midnight, I imagine.' My grandmother had begun to show some signs of dementia or just basic old age and so the weird comments weren\'t too out of character. And, my aunt assumed that the hospital one of her siblings had already called to tell their mother the news. \n My aunt shook it off and drove to the morgue. When she saw the death certificate she was shocked to see the time of death listed as 12:10 A.M. On her way home she stopped back at my grandmother\'s and asked her who had called her to tell her the news and asked why she said that she thought he\'d died 'just past midnight.' My grandmother said 'he came to see me at 12:30 and we talked for a spell. He wanted to apologize for all he\'d done to me and you kids. I think he made his peace and was able to move on, so I'm glad for that.' My grandmother than resumed humming and doing a jigsaw puzzle. \n TL;DR: my grandmother knew her ex-husband had died and the approximate time of his death because his ghost visited her in the middle of the night.",

       description="Driving in the UK from a friends dinner party. We set off at around 10 p.m. for a 15-minute drive home. There was myself, my wife in the front, and my three sons in the back of the car. We were driving near a USAF base in the southeast of England along a long straight piece of road when there was an incredible flash that the wife and I noticed, and it seemed to wake up one of the elder sons in the back (he would have been about 12 at the time.) Something, I have no idea what, flew with absolute silence over the car. I saw it, my wife saw it, and the son in the back who was awakened by the flash saw it. Something flew right over us so close you could touch it and it was BIG. We got home, discussed it a bit, and concluded the flash was a flare from the USAF base and the large 'object' that flew over us may well have been a Eurasian Eagle Owl (one had been spotted in this area). It was promptly forgotten… \n Fast forward just over a decade, and I and the son who was woken by the flash are talking about this weird event over dinner when the youngest son (who didn't wake up during the event) tells us how he remembered it happening. He recalled an event that was vastly different than ours. He had never told this story before. He thought it was a dream until we started talking about it. He described how the car was stopped when we saw the flash. We weren't moving, and the low flying object sat on top of us for a few seconds then flew off before the car started again. Apparently, I completely ignored this stop/start and simply continued driving. Now, here's the really cool bit that we had never realized. My wife had made arrangements to call her sister when we arrived home safely. We left at around 10 p.m. for a 15-minute drive. My wife called her sister around 11:45 p.m. to say we had arrived home. \n I have no idea what happened that night. I was completely sober. My youngest son insists that something very odd happened. My wife is adamant that we took approximately 90 minutes to do a 15-minute drive. Her sister backs this up. I might not know what happened that night but I am secure in the thought that SOMETHING happened",

       title="Small hooded figure in my house.",
       description="So myself and my husband built our house 2 years ago. \n We've had strange happenings in the house like all the doors closing in perfect order at night with no windows open and hearing strange screeching noises. Bit scary, but the next is insomnia worthy. \n I was laying on the couch watching my one year old son playing and all of a sudden he runs to me, frightened. I then see a small figure, up to the height of the handle of the door in the corner of the room. (In front of a door leading out to the hall) \n The figure (looked to be an old female) was in all black and hunched over. It's hands were clasped together, giving the appearance that it was begging/praying. All covered by a large old style black cloak with a hood, partially covering her face. \n I was terrified but grabbed my son and sat down on the couch. I began talking to the thing. I was saying how it's always welcome and how it can stay for however long it wishes etc. I also said the Our Father. \n I'm not sure how long the thing stayed for, but it was likely around 20 minutes. It didn't say a word. It made ever so slight movements (only barely moving it's head occasionally). It disappeared while i wasn't looking, as in i looked away and looked back to see it had gone. I checked the door and saw a shape left on the door in a rough shape of the figure. It's shape was almost ‘burned' into the door. Anyone know what this could've been? \n There were houses on the land before our house was built-back in famine times (mid 1800s) here in Ireland, and it's possible there was a lot of struggle and maybe even tragic death on the land during those times. So any ideas?",

       title="Saw a shadow person",
       description="So a little background here: I have been living in my apartment for over a year and have not had any experiences here at all. No weird noises, no strange shadows, no spooky vibes - just nothing. Until yesterday... Me and my 15yo daughter were watching tv in the living room and my other daughter who is 7 was in her game room which is in a hallway off the living room, right across from the girls' bedroom. From where I sit on the couch I can see the open door of my daughters' bedroom. Now, it's an old house - built prolly in the 70s-ish - so it's creaky (has all wood floors except in the bathroom and kitchen). But I am used to hearing creaks and pops from wood contracting and expanding from temperature changes, etc. Anyway, me and my 15yo heard a sound like something small dropping on the floor right at the edge of where the hallway starts from the living room. We both looked up. My 15yo said maybe it was her sister tryna creep up and scare us (even tho she doesn't do that kinda stuff but I think she was just startled and said that). Immediately when I looked up I saw a solid, black figure coming out of the girls' bedroom. My first thought was that my 7yo must have gone to her bedroom and for some reason put one of her sister's hoodies on and I just happened to see her leave the room. BUT. She has never done this and if she wanted to wear something of her sister's then she would ask first. But to be on the safe side I called my 7yo into the room. She came in in the same pink shirt she had been wearing the whole day - no black hoodie. So my second thought was OMFG SOMEONE BROKE INTO THE HOUSE. Somehow. Silently. Maybe someone opened a window in my girls' bedroom, climbed over the beds, and walked outta the room quieter than a ninja. So I get the girls in a safe spot and give my 15yo my phone and tell her if I scream then dial 911 blah blah blah. I looked everywhere and there was no one but us in the house. No one. But I know what I saw. I SAW a SOLID, BLACK FIGURE leaving my daughters' room... Like wtf? How? I have been in apartments where I saw figures and heard noises and weird shit happened but since I moved in here (over a year ago) I haven't had anything at all happen. Like zero. So I just wanna know if anyone else had had this happen too, and should I be concerned that this sudden activity will become more frequent, or wth? Sorry this was so long but damn lol",

       description="I was around 8 or slightly older at the time of this story. My mom has told me I talked to myself a lot when I was younger and saw stuff. I remember hearing things, but never seeing. This is is the only time I remember clearly seeing something. \n I remember going to my aunt's house with my mom. It was just my aunt, mom and myself in the house. They were talking in a bedroom and I wanted to get their attention to tell them something (don't remember what). I kept pestering them and my mom got angry and told me to leave them alone and go to the play room. The play room was big empty room with some balls and a toy basket ball hoop. When I was walking into the room I didn't see anything out of place. Once inside I looked towards the corner of the room where the bag with all the balls usually is and instead I am see a crouched black figure in the corner. I see it stand up and stretch its black wings. It told me to go with him or something along those lines. I was scared and ran to my mom in the other room. I told her there was something in the play room, but once we got there it was gone. \n I don't remember if it looked human or not, but I clearly remember the big black wings. It feels like a bad dream. When I asked my mom about it, she says that she remembers telling me to leave and me coming back to her scared out of my mind.",

       title="Three claw marks",
       description="I was changing my two year old son and noticed some claw like marks on him so I asked him who hurt him. He tells me “the monster hurt me mommy”, so I asked where is the monster and he points in the corner of his room. Now this freaked me out because for the past five months I have woken up in the middle of the night to find him looking in the corner and talking as if someone was talking back to him. So I brushed it off and set him down for his nap, trying not to make a big deal of it since I know the more attention you give it the more it feeds off of that. Two hours later I walk into the room to find him looking at that same corner, talking to no one. He looks up at me and points at the corner and says look at my friend mommy. No soon as he says this the full length mirror on the door falls right off, shattering. I had to bite my tongue and keep from yelling. Now a little backstory, my house is 150 years old. I've lived here ever since I was a child. And I've always had a very dark, terrible feeling wash over me in certain parts of the house. The basement is where I feel it the worst. Even as a child I would hate going down to the basement. I can't keep my back to the boiler room because I feel so uneasy as if something is behind me in there. I've had that feeling in other places as well, like cemeteries and stuff. I've explored places that are said to be haunted. I got into all of this stuff because of my past experiences as a child living in this house and having the kinds of feelings that I do. I'd love to hear everyone's thoughts on this though. What could possibly be going on here?",

       title="Unknown woman in our house who's not my wife",
       description="This happened in 2020, just a few months after the pandemic. My job had allowed me to work from home and that gave me the opportunity to be at home with my 3 year old son at the time. The incidents I'm about to mention has happened 3 times. In order of event: \n 1: My office room which I use to work remotely is located by the stairs. If you walk up the stairs, my room is to the left. To the left of my room is a hallway to the master bedroom. One day as I was working I saw my wife walking up the stairs and went to the master bedroom. Moments later I followed her and began asking her if she wanted to go out for dinner or cook something together. I didn't hear a response. So I went to check inside the master bathroom, and then the walk-in closet, she's not in the room. I walked down stairs and saw her with my son. I asked her, hey did you went up stairs earlier? She said No, I just got home from work. \n 2: I am working in my office, my son is in the room with me, and again noticed my wife walking to the master bedroom. I continued working, my son is on his iPad. I never saw her left the room or went back down stairs. So I assumed she's still in the room. Moments later, I saw her again walking to the master bedroom from the stairs, passing my room. I followed, out of curiosity, and she was not in the master bedroom. I went down stairs to check but she was not there either. I went back to my room, my son is not in there anymore. His iPad is on my chair. I called his name and searched for him, he doesn't respond. I looked around and finally found him in our walk-in closet. I asked him why is he there, and he said that he heard mommy told him to go there. \n 3: I'm in my room with my son, this time I'm not facing my door as I was on my other desk reading a book. My back facing the door. My son is playing with his LEGOs. He kept calling me, dad look at me, look what I made. But I told him not now, dad is working. Moments later I hear him yelling out, mommy mommy look at me look at what I made. He says this while running to the master bedroom. Then, instantly I heard him ran back, he stood at my door, his face was pale and plain, he stood there still, not blinking and eyes wide open, in shocked, frightened. Unsure what to say or do next. Immediately, I knew that he didn't see his mom when he ran there. I quickly went to hug him and pick him up away from my door way and shut the door. I can feel his heart pounding and trying to breath harder. I told him not to say anything. To not even describe to me what he see, because I want him to forget it. I tried to shift that moment to something more pleasant. I turn on the tv in my room and we watched his favorite cartoon until my wife got home. \n A week later, my wife was given the chance to work at home, she now sets her office in the master bedroom. Ever since she started working at home, we no longer saw this strange woman figure that keeps walking into the master bedroom.",

       title="A psychic predicted my childhood home burning down",
       description="Okay so I hate writing lengthy stories but here we go, this event happen in May 2003. \n I grew up in small rural town in Illinois. Growing up in my neighborhood, everyone knew everyone-all the adults knew each other and all the kids on that block. As a child I never really put it together, but my parents and all the adults in that neighborhood threw A LOT of “block parties”. \n All the adults would typically gather onto one porch and drink, smoke and play loud music. As we slowly watch our parents get drunk, all of us kids would be playing in the dark, jumping on the trampoline, swimming in pools until 12am sometimes! (On a school night)….Good Ol' days… \n On one of those nights, my mother decided to have the big party on our backyard deck. Later on when people started to arrive. One of our neighbors brought one of their friends over. (This was something I didn't know until after the fire). I'm sure my mom didn't care anyways. \n I remember being in the swimming pool, which was right next to the deck. I was with a few of my neighborhood friends, I remember smelling food on the grill and cigarette smoke. I remember “my crush” splashed me in the face and of course that made me want to turn around and splash him back. As I turn around to say something witty like “omg!” I got caught off guard and startled when I heard this woman scream and I look over at her and she was staring at my house. \n She immediately stood up and told my mother that my house was in flames! ……My house was fine at the time…..so now she is starting to look a little crazy. My little sister was too young to understand what we all “thought” - that she was crazy. She took her words literal and thought our house was currently on fire. She started to cry, (she was 6) so my mom asked the lady if she could leave since she was scaring her children…….and I'm sure my mom was little freaked out too. \n As her friend escorts her off the deck, she says “she will cause the fire I see” pointing to my older sister. My older sister was in the front yard talking with her friends. \n We all thought it was strange that night, even after she left but life goes on… \n So fast forward to September, Labor Day weekend. \n My younger sister and I are at my uncle's annual pig roast - more like a big Mexican reunion. 😂😂 My mom and her husband were on a motorcycle ride in Milwaukee, WI. They were at a rest stop when my mom received a phone call from our neighbor, when she answered the phone our neighbor said in very hesitated voice. \n “Elizabeth..(my moms name) I don't know how to say this…but your house is on fire!” \n Our neighbor thankfully called 911 and said that they are on the way. After that phone call my mom headed over to get us and we all drove to our house, that was now on fire. 💔 \n When we pulled up to the house, my mom told us to wait in the car. I remember looking at our house and seeing all the flames and all the smoke, it was a bit traumatizing. My mom started freaking out because she thought our nanny (our 2nd cousin/family member) was inside our house. My mom called our babysitter who answered right away and told her that she was coming back to the house with my older sister right now. My mom thought that that was strange because our nanny was practically living with us so she was watching the house for that day. \n My mom was told that the fire was caused by our electric stove. and OMG, she was LIVID. \n After my mother and our nanny had talked to the fireman. We all were in the together and that's when my mom asked the babysitter what happen? \n Our nanny, in tears, said she had accidentally left the oven before she left, then she preceded to say “I accidentally left it on because (my OLDER SISTER) was in a car accident.” \n  Apparently my older sister and her friends were (underage) drinking and hit a parked car. \n (drinking and driving is terrible!) \n Our nanny apparently was just about to cook food when my older sister called our nanny and said she needed to be picked up immediately because the cops were on the way. \n She didn't want to be arrested for underage drinking and she also was NOT the one driving. \n Our nanny said after hearing that, nothing mattered, she said she dropped the phone, left the house and accidentally leaving the stove on. \n That's my one and only experience with a psychic. They can be channel, so I don't think it was just a coincidence. \n Idk what you guys think?",

       title="Help me explain this event",
       description="So I've told this story to a couple people, but no one has been able to offer any believable explanation to how or why this happened. \n Around 2006 my family moved to South West England and moved into a detached home in a medieval city. I was around 11 at the time and my older sister was 13 and we lived with our mother and father. \n We were only made aware after we moved in that this house was known to the locals as a paranormal house, and we actually had builders and renovators straight up refuse to work on the house after we told them the address. We were also told the house was being sold by a couple who were in the middle of a divorce, but it wasn't till years later we discovered the house had been empty for years before we moved in. Not sure if that's important to know but thought I'd mention. Anyway, there was a lot of peculiar incidents that happened in the house whilst we were there. Doors jamming, random knocks and bangs, our dog physically refused to walk up the steps to the house and seemed very uncomfortable when we first moved in, but we all put that down to it being a new home, and that there was always an explanation. \n So throughout the years living there, a lot of people experienced weird and unexplainable things that happened. Although I witnessed some pretty weird stuff, there was one night that will always stay with me. Something that try as I might I can't really explain, so I'm reaching out to reditt in order to give me some clarity to that evening if that's possible. \n It was 2010, my parents were now separated and my sister was staying with friends so it was just me and my father in the house. It was the middle of the night, we were both asleep, when I was woken by the sound of a radio going off on the top floor of the house. It started off quiet but it was as if someone had their finger on the volume and it suddenly went from quiet and grew to as loud as it could get. My dad, obviously irritated, thought it was me staying up late and playing music, and I heard him get out of bed, shouting to turn the music down as he went upstairs to where the noise was coming from. I remember hearing him go silent mid sentence, the radio turning off, and footsteps going downstairs as he went back to bed. Of course I was rattled at this strange occurrence, our dog wasn't allowed upstairs and we had no other pets, so there was no other normal explanation to how the radio could have turned itself on like that. I attempted to go back to sleep, but after about 20 minutes, I was woken again by the sound of a radio turning on, and the sound going from quiet to loud in a matter of seconds. I was paralyzed in my bed, terrified at what was going on. I heard my dad get out of bed and go to the sound of the radio, which was now coming from my sister's empty bedroom (she was at the sleepover) except when he opened her door there was a sudden loud crash. I jumped out of bed and turned on my bedroom light and ran to my sister's room to see what the noise was. My dad was stood by the door, and on the floor was the radio, still playing, but about 4 feet across the room from where it usually was on her desk. It was as if someone had thrown the radio from her desk. My dad is not someone who believes in the paranormal, but even I could tell he was shocked. After a few seconds he picked up the radio and unplugged it, and placed it back on my sisters desk. He told me to go back to bed and we never spoke of it again. Didn't even tell my sister. I know there's an explanation to bumps in the night and stuff like that, but I've never been able to come up with a reasonable explanation to this. I welcome any suggestions. I should also say that they were both the same iPod dock/radio, that both me and my sister had been gifted a couple years prior. We kept those speaker/radios for years and never experienced anything like that again.",

       description="Long read but promise it's a real experience, pls read and help if possible. \n First time poster in this sub, but this has haunted me for about a decade now and it's time I share it. If anyone can help find the audio I'm looking for it would be greatly appreciated. \n About 10 or so years ago, I have the house to myself (still living with parents at the time) and I have a friend staying over, the night is going smoothly and normal (we're playing co-op video games, as teenage boys do) but eventually we both end up on our phones scrolling through Tumblr. \n My friend stumbles upon a 40-50 minute audiotape file of a private investigator talking to a high school campus about his experience during a murder investigation he's conducted, I believe it took place in Texas iirc. Long story short, towards the end of this audio file, it all leads up to the PI believing that the victim was exposed to a demon, or evil entity, who was the reason for the death of this person. He states at the very end testimony of this case, that this demon feeds off of your fear, and the more you think about it, the stronger its energy and presence gets. As far as we could both tell, it was a real testimony and not a parody or creepypasta. \n So me and friend hear the whole 40 or so minutes of testimony, (we were just enthralled, almost hypnotized by it) and afterward we try to go back to playing our games. Well not 5 minutes later, the power in my room, and my room only goes out. No big deal, so I just go and flip the breaker and turn it back on. 3 minutes later, boom. Again.

This continues with shorter time frames until the power in my room just won't come back on. \n The first time it happens we think it's mere coincidence but by this point fear is really happening and the thought of this entity is in our heads. \n At this point (about 12-1 am) my friend decides that this isn't worth it for him and he heads back to his place (lol, thanks) leaving me by myself. \n So the night goes on a little bit and after friend leaves I spend the rest of the night in my living room, lights on and crash on the couch. \n I wake up with the TV still on and it's between 3-4 am, and idk wtf possessed me to go back to my room to sleep, but for some reason, I convince myself it's all in my head and head to my bed to sleep. \n I fall asleep incredibly fast and my dream begins with me, in my bed and room (just as it was laid out in real life), in the pitch black. This was extremely vivid and an exact replica of my room, I was as lucid as I would've been awake. But in one of the top corners of my room, where the wall meets the ceiling, I saw a pair of angry, dirty yellow looking eyes that were on a pitch blacker than black figure hanging on my ceiling, just staring into my soul. \n I was fixated on these eyes, and they were fixated on me, I was just in shock and couldn't move, but the second I tried to move at all, the shadow figure zoomed to another corner of my ceiling, and then launched at me. I woke up in a sweat JUST before I get contacted. The dream felt so fucking real and vivid and I woke up literally screaming. There was a real sense of dread that took over my entire body in that moment, I felt mentally and physically sick. \n Power was still not working in my room so went out to the living room again and finished the night with all the lights on, not sleeping at all. Nothing more ever came from that night, but as far as I can tell and find, that audiotape never existed. I've spent days upon days trying to find it multiple times all over the internet and nothing even close comes up on search results. Btw the power to my room worked perfectly the following day after the sun rose and has worked perfectly ever since. \n Sorry for the huge read. I SWEAR this is a true experience that happened to me personally and nothing was fabricated in any way. \n I've tried so many times to explain it rationally and to find the audiotape we listened to that night and to this day I haven't come close and neither has my friend, but we both remember the night like it was yesterday. \n Thanks for reading and sticking around this long. Just glad I finally decided to share this encounter. \n TLDR; heard a haunted audiotape that spawned a demon/shadow figure in my room, haven't found any proof of audiotape existing since that night.",

       title="Ghost from Europe haunted me for over 2 years.",
       description="This is my very real story that happened in 2014. My family flew from the US to Wales for my brother's wedding. We stayed in a very old remodeled barn party house in Abergavenny. It was right below the canal, and we had a free day before the wedding party was meeting at the local pub that night. I got back from a run at the canal, showered, and had time to take a nap (still a little jet lagged) before dinner. \n As I'm lying in bed I feel the presence of a woman and then feel the front side of a hand stroke my cheek. Then feel the entity jump on me and pin me to the bed. I'm struggling, and finally get free. I then hear a woman's cackle and laugh three times like Ha ha ha. \n This was witnessed. My door was half open and there was a sitting area outside and my mom was sitting there and said she saw me laying in bed struggling. She did not hear the laugh. Nothing else happened during the trip. \n The next month I started dating a woman who would eventually move in and become my wife. This is when things started getting weird. Anytime she would spend the night, if we fell asleep with an arm or leg touching each other we would both have terrible nightmares. I don't ever have bad dreams or nightmares. One that I recall vividly was an extremely old and wrinkled woman in black and white screaming at me in a foreign language I didn't understand. We would make a point to sleep far apart as possible to avoid the dreams. \n Then one night I have a dream. I am in this astral plane and everything is blue around me. Standing in front of me is a young petite woman. She was short (like 5 feet tall) and looked very european with a round face and dark blonde hair. She was dressed in very period correct plain clothing from a long time ago and wasn't wearing make up. She walked up to me and said 'My name is Abigela' and nothing else. I tried talking to her but that is all she said. \n Now I never heard the name Abigela in my life. Google it and see it's eastern european for Abigail. After that Abigela got really spiteful and tried to wreck our relationship. A couple key things that happened. Pulled my wife's hair. She was walking up our steps and was talking to me and I see as if someone grabbed her hair as to yank her down the steps. She froze and we just looked at each other. Bent her engagement ring. It was on the dresser and one morning she showed me it was so smashed she couldn't get it on her ring finger. And to me, loaded a conversation from google hangouts when I was talking to another woman before I met my wife. I didn't even have hangouts installed on the phone, that convo happened on my previous phone. Thankfully it was date stamped and I settled her down and showed her. Other small things like hiding stuff. Stuff was going missing constantly. One time we bought a bunch of meat and it was in this huge bag and we set it down in the basement to put other groceries away and it was gone. We looked everywhere and didn't find it until a year later when there was a bag of rotting meat in the basement. \n As the next couple years went on things started to die down, and when we married they stopped. I guess she finally gave up. I never had any sage cleansing done or had a medium visit the house because I didn't want to make things worse and present a challenge for the entity to fight. But I was researching mediums and was close.",

       title="Something keeps stealing our spoons",
       description="My family has been having this issue ever since we moved into our apartment 6 years ago. Something lives with us in here, that much is very clear, and fortunately it’s not malevolent. However, it’s annoyingly mischievous. \n The first time we noticed our spoons going missing was 4 years ago. My mum complained about my brothers eating in their rooms and not washing their dishes, but my brothers swore up and down that they did do them. Over time, almost all of our spoons were gone and we didn’t know where they went. My dad decided to buy a new set, thinking that they could have been accidentally thrown out. Fast forward to after summer vacation, my mum was doing some deep cleaning of her room when she found a whole pile of spoons under her bed. And it wasn’t just spoons - there were some forks, two knives and a couple of pens. \n Our spoons still go missing. Nowadays, it doesn’t get to the point where we don’t have any spoons at all, but there will be times when the number of missing spoons is very noticeable. Just last week, we were only left with 4 spoons out of the 12 that we have. My mum’s knives have also gone missing. They’re probably under my parents’ bed as per usual. My dad said he’ll get them back sometime within the week. \n My family doesn’t know what kind of creature is playing pranks on them. In our family, only my father and I are sensitive to paranormal stuff, but I’m the only one who has seen the creature that has been pranking us. In 2019, I was confronted by a dark figure when I was home alone. I go to another country to study and had just arrived back home some few days before - it was the first time in almost 2 years that I saw my family. The creature didn’t like me being in the apartment and saw me as a nuisance. I told it that I’m part of the family living there and to please not bother me. It took some minutes of persuading before it finally left me alone. I haven’t seen it since then, but it continues it’s spoon-stealing spree.",
