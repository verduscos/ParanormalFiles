       title="It came for us in the graveyard",
       description="We were driving my friend's really old beat up Subaru through a massive graveyard. We stopped and walked down a hill and came across a little pond. There was someone sitting on a rock on the other side of the pond. The figure was all black and we couldn't make out any features other than the fact it looked like a man who was wearing some old-style top hat. We stupidly waved and shouted “Hi!”. He didn't show any acknowledgement and continued sitting still on the rock. All of a sudden, he jumped to his feet, started running to us on the water and then vanished in thin water about halfway on the pond. My friends and I screamed and ran back to the car.\n The car wouldn't start, and we heard something banging on the back of the car. It wasn't a constant bang, but every few seconds or so we'd hear it. Nobody was outside from what we could see in the dark, but something was making a noise on the car. I opened my phone and started dialing my mom to come give us a boost, but I had no service. None of us had any cell service. The next 30 minutes were spent trying to get her car started. No banging was heard afterwards, but we felt this heavy pressure around us. \n Finally, the car started and she hit the pedal to the metal. We sped out of the graveyard so fast. Immediately crossing the gates, all of our phones regained cell service. One thing I know for certain is that someone or something was out there, and it was not an animal or a human.",

       title="My mother attracted evil",
       description="After my parents divorced when I was a teenager, I lived with my mother. I experienced lots of paranormal happenings. Several times when I was reading in my bed, the room would start to feel really “icy.” Next, it would feel as if something/somebody that hated me was staring at me. When I got that feeling, I would leave the room and come back an hour later. Sometimes during the day, I would see a shadow figure sneaking along my bedroom walls. \n Something in the flat was pretending to be my dog. I went into my room and heard a deep growl from under the bed. My dog wasn't capable of making a noise that deep. It sounded like either a really big dog or a man doing his best dog impersonation. Other times, my dog would whimper and pace in the room next to mine but wouldn't come when called, as if he was afraid of something in the hallway. \n When I moved in with my father, the paranormal activity stopped.",

       title="Something helped us in the swamp",
       description="I was 12 at the time and my family has a camp on the Tangipahoa River in Louisiana. The only way you can get to it is by boat. So it was just my uncle, my cousin, and myself and we were heading back to the boat launch on a Sunday night. Now the boat we were in didn't have any working lights, so to see where we were going my uncle would occasionally shoot a flare. We quickly ran out of the flares you shoot as it is around a 2-hour boat ride back to the landing. So I ended up on the front of the boat holding a regular flare as we were now on a much narrower stretch of river. \n to the right. I was just trying to keep the flare from burning me, and my little cousin was freaking out. After around 10 minutes of them navigating through the swamp, they formed a triangle above us on the river. It is hard to gauge how far up they were, but it was very visible. \n They continued to follow us for the rest of the journey back to the landing, and as soon as we arrived they disappeared. This all happened around 18 years ago but it is something I will never forget. I don't talk about this stuff really and usually just keep it to myself.",

       title="My Grandma saw my Grandpa",
       description="(okay, not me, but my family). \n My grandfather was a baaad man. Alcoholic, extremely violent, tried to kill my grandmother in front of their kids. One of his less horrible acts was abandoning my grandmother with their six kids, all under the age of 12. Some of his kids maintained minimal contact with him. He lived about thirty or forty miles from my grandmother and the two kids who'd stayed in the area. \n When he was in his 80s he was hospitalized and then passed away in the middle of the night. In the morning his oldest child, one of my aunts, went to the morgue to identify the body and fill out paperwork. On her way she stopped by my grandmother's to break the news. When she came in my grandmother said 'oh it's a sad day. He died just past midnight, I imagine.' My grandmother had begun to show some signs of dementia or just basic old age and so the weird comments weren\'t too out of character. And, my aunt assumed that the hospital one of her siblings had already called to tell their mother the news. \n My aunt shook it off and drove to the morgue. When she saw the death certificate she was shocked to see the time of death listed as 12:10 A.M. On her way home she stopped back at my grandmother\'s and asked her who had called her to tell her the news and asked why she said that she thought he\'d died 'just past midnight.' My grandmother said 'he came to see me at 12:30 and we talked for a spell. He wanted to apologize for all he\'d done to me and you kids. I think he made his peace and was able to move on, so I'm glad for that.' My grandmother than resumed humming and doing a jigsaw puzzle. \n TL;DR: my grandmother knew her ex-husband had died and the approximate time of his death because his ghost visited her in the middle of the night.",

       title="The missing Hour",
       description="Driving in the UK from a friends dinner party. We set off at around 10 p.m. for a 15-minute drive home. There was myself, my wife in the front, and my three sons in the back of the car. We were driving near a USAF base in the southeast of England along a long straight piece of road when there was an incredible flash that the wife and I noticed, and it seemed to wake up one of the elder sons in the back (he would have been about 12 at the time.) Something, I have no idea what, flew with absolute silence over the car. I saw it, my wife saw it, and the son in the back who was awakened by the flash saw it. Something flew right over us so close you could touch it and it was BIG. We got home, discussed it a bit, and concluded the flash was a flare from the USAF base and the large 'object' that flew over us may well have been a Eurasian Eagle Owl (one had been spotted in this area). It was promptly forgotten… \n Fast forward just over a decade, and I and the son who was woken by the flash are talking about this weird event over dinner when the youngest son (who didn't wake up during the event) tells us how he remembered it happening. He recalled an event that was vastly different than ours. He had never told this story before. He thought it was a dream until we started talking about it. He described how the car was stopped when we saw the flash. We weren't moving, and the low flying object sat on top of us for a few seconds then flew off before the car started again. Apparently, I completely ignored this stop/start and simply continued driving. Now, here's the really cool bit that we had never realized. My wife had made arrangements to call her sister when we arrived home safely. We left at around 10 p.m. for a 15-minute drive. My wife called her sister around 11:45 p.m. to say we had arrived home. \n I have no idea what happened that night. I was completely sober. My youngest son insists that something very odd happened. My wife is adamant that we took approximately 90 minutes to do a 15-minute drive. Her sister backs this up. I might not know what happened that night but I am secure in the thought that SOMETHING happened",
